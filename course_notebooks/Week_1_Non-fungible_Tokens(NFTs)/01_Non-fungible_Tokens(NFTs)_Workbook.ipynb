    "\n",
    "#### 🛸 Zeppelin Integration\n",
    "Remember what defines an NFTs? The **ERC-721** standard. Instead of copy and pasting the code defining this standard we simply import this from [OpenZeppelin](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/erc721#constructing_an_erc721_token_contract).  \n",

    "\n",
    "#### 📜 Contract object\n",
    "Every solidity contract starts with the `contract` keyword - it is an object holding your contract functions and variables. It can itself inherit from other contracts. And this is what we do here: we inherit the **ERC-721** class into our solidity object. Add this code:  \n",

    "The problem with on-chain NFTs: it can be costly! Whenever we change the blockchain it costs gas and the more we change the more gas. But how can we store an image on the blockchain? Technically you can store the images data in the smart contract. But unless your image is not just 8x8 pixels it would be to inefficient.    \n",

    "Vectors are perfect for on-chain storage. A common format for vectors is `svg`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🎨 Create an `svg`\n",
    "Let's start by creating a simple `svg` image. Nothing fancy, just a colored rectangle with some text in the middle:\n",
    "```\n",
