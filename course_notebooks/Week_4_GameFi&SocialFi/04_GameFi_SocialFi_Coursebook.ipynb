    "\n",
    "> **GameFi (GameFinance)** involves blockchain games that offer economic incentives to play them, otherwise known as play-to-earn games. Typically, players can earn in-game rewards by completing tasks, battling other players or progressing through various game levels. Additionally, the player is able to own game assets in form of NFTs that can evolve and develop throughout the game.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **SocialFi (SocialFinance)** is a combination of social networking and finance to create decentralized social applications. Typically, network participants interact through social challenges, through which they can earn in-game rewards.\n",
    "\n",
    "Arguably, this field will offer a new cycle of Blockchain innovation beyond DeFi, and possibly initiate mass adoption to attract an entirely new wave of users.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, while GameFi/SocialFi shows promise, recent examples have branded this industry to be more of a ponzi scheme rather than a new and exciting developing field. As such, we will critically address the issues the industry have faced while also outlining the potential for growth.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note that GameFi and SocialFi are categories on their own and should be differentiated. Currently however, a lot of projects are intertwined in either category which makes it difficult to fully seperate them. We expect that the differences will become more clear and distinct as the fields develop. Lets' dive."

    "As we previously mostly explored the Ethereum Blockchain, which dominated the DeFi era, we are now seeing more and more chains that support promising GameFi projects, and provide the infrastructure with a focus on GameFi. Since GameFi projects generally require a higher scale of transactions due to in-game trades and rewards, a low transaction fee (i.e. gas fee) is critical. This is where Ethereum struggles due to its consensus mechanism and other aspects. At current Ethereum still supports the most amount of GameFi projects, however, the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) is a close second. While Ethereum puts a lot of emphasis on decentralisation and stability, BSC focusses on quicker and cheaper on chain transactions. Such differences are based on the trade-offs chains have to take. Commonly known also as the [Blockchain Trilemma](https://medium.com/certik/the-blockchain-trilemma-decentralized-scalable-and-secure-e9d8c41a87b3), a term coined by Vitalik Buterin.\n",

    "### The Token Economy of GameFi projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The basic principles of a Game economy\n",
    "\n",
    "A game’s economy is the flow of resources between its systems and players. You move through the game, complete tasks and win challenges through which you are rewarded with the in-game currency which can be used to buy items. Sounds familiar? Well thats because in-game economies have existed for a long-time. What is new to crypto games however, are the core concepts of decentralisation and autonomy. As a player you are not simply investing your time for the entertainment, but also have the chance to own part of the game yourself by owning game native tokens or in-game NFT items. Either can be exchanged for real money at any point, which makes a functioning token economy critical for a games success.\n",
    "\n",
    "When talking game economies there are two helpful concepts: Taps and sinks.\n",
    "\n",
    "A tap is the source of in-game resources (i.e. you receive gold for finishing quests). A sink is where resources are destroyed or exchanged (i.e. buy an item for the gold earned). The analogy of a tap and a sink makes a lot of sense because it allows us to build a mental picture of a resources flow; If the tap is generating the resource quicker than the sink can remove it then an excess builds. Any resource that is in excess becomes effectively worthless to the player and they stop interacting with the tap.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the inverse can also be true: When there is too little resource coming from a tap then there is little motivation for a player to interactive with it. The correct balance between a tap and a sink is known as a pinch point.\n",
    "\n",
    "In economics a pinch point is the level of supply of a commodity at which demand is maximised due to consumers becoming concerned about the supply. In games we can think about this as the point where the supply shows the utility of a resource but is scarce enough to have players continue to seek it.\n",
    "\n",

  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "#### Play-to-earn\n",
    "\n",
    "The way crypto games have tried to achieve a pinch point, while still attracting crypto native players, is through the play-to-earn model. In order to enter and play-to-earn, players have to make an initial investment to qualify. This normally comes in form of an NFT, that costs around $100 to $1k (prices can vary due to volatility of coin prices), that differ based on their in-game traits and utility. Some might be more expensive due to a more variable trait such as being able to generate more resources more quickly. Now you can start earning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Such model works if the player base continues to rise, and earned currency is reinvested into the economy, instead of simply being earned-and-dumped (exchanged for ETH or another currency outside the game's reach). If however, there are no new incoming players to purchase NFTs to play-to-earn and the existing playerbase is not reinvesting into the economy, the result will be an inflationary game economy."

  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",

    "#### Inflation & Deflation\n",
    "\n",
    "Just like in the real economy, **inflation** and the abundance of in-game resources lead to an increase in cost of items. Additionally, the value of the token falls. For a player base that at current mostly consists of crypto investors that are driven by earn first, and put no emphasis on if the game is “fun” such outcome would be deadly.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the game provides enough incentive to reinvest and burn the players tokens in the process, the supply of overall coins is reduced and can increase price and so benefit the remaining holders. As such, token holders often like token burns when there is a set supply cap, making the token **deflationary**."

    "\n",
    "- **Governance Tokens**: These tokens act much like company shares, with the holder able to use their tokens to vote on gameplay and to gain a share of a profit.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Axie Infinity\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most prominent GameFi games is called [Axie Infinity](https://axieinfinity.com/). It was arguably the first game that proved the viability of the play-to-earn model. At some point, they had 2,800,000 daily active players, that traded $3.6Bn in their in-game marketplace, with one of their NFTs to be sold for $820,000.\n",
    "\n",
    "The game is a virtual world full of pets called Axies. Axies can be battled, collected, and used to earn cryptocurrencies. Players need to connect with a special wallet specially designed for Axies designed for running on *Ronin*, an Ethereum sidechain. Players further need to download the game.\n",

    "\n",
    "Axie's game economy centers around three tokens. The in-game cryptocurrency SLP; the axie NFTS; and the “governance token” AXS. The game produces two of those resources in constantly increasing quantities. SLP is earned through player-versus-player battles, and, previously it was also available by completing daily quests and grinding in single-player mode, the equivalent of printing money and handing it to players in large quantities. Axies can be bred several times to produce new creatures and are largely immortal, so the breeding mechanic increases the pool of NFTs. \n",

    "We previously discussed that Games often include economic “sinks” that burn resources without producing more. By contrast, Axie Infinity players had two main options: they could sell their SLP — which pumped it back into the ecosystem — or use it to breed axies whose main function is producing even more SLP. Either way, they were creating more resources and watering down the value of everything acquired in the game. This resulted in a disastrous development of their in-game currency.\n",

    "Blockchain games are games that have some of their core mechanics handled by the blockchain. It’s a continuum ranging from **\"weakly\" on-chain games** that for example only require the player to buy an NFT to play the off-chain game, to **\"strongly\" on-chain games** that require the player to interact with the blockchain in every detail of the game.\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Multi-accounting** refers to how to identify the player. *Most games implicitly rely on the following rule: one player = one human. If not, this means that someone else could be playing in the name of the player*. Possible solutions are:   \n",
    "    - An NFT acts as a proof of ownership. The NFT should also be costly enough so that \"hijacking\" another players account is not worth it.\n",
    "    - To proof a player's human identity can come in many ways: a player can proof her identity by performing specific actions (e.g. minimum number of votes) or the game can have a built-in reputation system for every player (e.g. reputation increases with total time played). Finally, some third-party services (e.g. [Proof of Humanity](https://www.proofofhumanity.id/) offer on-chain identity-checking.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Key Management** refers to the use of private keys to sign transactions. *The more actions players can perform, the more they will have to sign transactions, the more the Metamask wallet will pop up and annoy the player.* Possible solutions are:   \n",
    "    -   key pairs for \"non-sensitive\" game actions stored temporary (e.g. during game session) local or on a client side \n",
    "    - use of **smart wallets** in which players can define in advance which kind of transactions are allowed\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Hiding Information** refers to the problem that every player can look up the others players move on the blockchain. *Games like poker would be useless on-chain*. Possible solutions are:\n",
    "    - Commit-reveal schemes use hashing to store \"game-sensitive\" information on-chain. E.g.: for a game like **rock-scissor-paper** each player would hash his choice together with a number or word. After both players transmitted the hash they have to reveal their number to proof the correctness of their choice.\n",
    "    - Zero-knowledge proofs store only the result of a set of actions on-chain rather than the actions itself (e.g. a cook does not need to reveal it's recipe to prove that he can cook a certain meal or a sudoku solution can be proofed by summing up rows and columns).    \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Cheat-to-earn** refers to the problem that players could use *game-bots* which plays in their behalf. This is not pure on-chain gaming problem as more a problem in play-to-earn settings. Possible solutions are:\n",
    "    - make the game settings too difficult for bots  \n",
    "    - implement human interaction (e.g. players need to interact ocassionally on *Discord*)   \n",

    "### Metaverse\n",
    "The metaverse is a three-dimensional virtual space that resembles our real world. Users in the Metaverse can come together inside a digital universe, socialize, and do activities like playing games, visiting shopping malls, working in a virtual office and hanging out with friends.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although the term metaverse is a placeholder for a lot of things and hopes, one can mentally replace it  with **cyberspace**. 99% of the time, the meaning won't substantially change.  \n",
    "Usually, the technologies companies refer to when they talk about *the metaverse* can include virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR).\n",
    "\n",
    "- VR is a computer-generated environment with scenes and objects that appear to be real, making the user feel they are immersed in their surroundings. This environment is perceived through a device like VR headset, goggle, helmet, motion controller and/or data suits.   \n",
    "- AR combines aspects of the digital and physical worlds.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other than in more *traditional* VR applications the virtual worlds of the metaverse continue to exist persistently even when you're not playing.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Another important aspect of the metaverse is the concept about a new digital economy, where users can create, buy, and sell goods virtually - hoping to overcome the disadvantages of *web2* where users content is often owned by big tech and monetizing content often limited. Metaverse therefore stands for *web3*: virtually all user content is *tokenizable* and transferable by the user. \n",

    "## Future Development\n",
    "### SocialFi Development\n",
    ">SocialFi is social influence on any medium that can be tokenized, allowing anybody to get direct monetary benefits from being on SocialFi platforms.\n",
    "\n",
    "The center of SocialFi is NFTs. NFTs make it possible to securely trade and sell digital content. They enable digital proof of ownership in real-world experiences that brands can create for their communities. Brands can generate revenues from these experiences after-the-fact, inspiring them to create viral content in the metaverse. E-Commerce will be extended by a virtual dimension in the metaverse leading to a marketing section: **virtual commerce** (V-Commerce):\n",
    "V-Commerce refers to a blend of digital and physical commerce. Unlike E-Commerce, V-Commerce will build a more seamless mix of digital and physical realities.  \n",
    "\n",
    "It can be also expected that more and more GameFi and SocialFi projects will merge together on-chain. For example: the *TIME* magazin (alrady owner of *[TIME Pieces](https://time.com/collection/timepieces-nft/)* - an NFT collection community) just announced a joint venture with *The Sandbox* to work together on the metaverse. \n",
    "\n",
    "At this moment, there are only about 300 million crypto users out of the world population of 7.9 billion people. The growth potential is uncapped.\n",
    "\n",
    "Identification is still an unsolved issue, although it's not a problem solely to web3. A promising approach is **Proof of Identity** (👉🏻 Industry), but the number of profiles are less than 17,000 so far.\n",
    "\n",
    "### GameFi Development  \n",
    "If we count *CryptoKittens* as the first example of how gaming could be introduced onto blockchains in November 2017 - *almost 2 years after Ethereum was introduced* - then we are as of today already 5 years into the GameFi age. \n",
    "\n",
    "The number of GameFi projects has boomed in 2021 and will likely continue to grow in the coming years. As of March 2022, there are more than 1,400 blockchain games listed in DappRadar with popular games across multiple blockchains, such as Ethereum, BNB Smart Chain (BSC), Polygon, Harmony, Solana, and many more.\n",
    "\n",
    "As blockchain technology continues to develop, the GameFi growing trend is expected to continue at a fast pace. The ability to own in-game assets and make money from games makes GameFi very attractive, especially in developing countries.\n",
    "\n",
    "The current GameFi landscape consists mostly of \"weakly\" on-chain games with a focus on *play-to-earn*:  in-game rewards can be transacted as NFTs on crypto exchanges and marketplaces, allowing players to cash them out into other cryptocurrencies and ultimately fiat.  The actual gameplay however, is (still) mostly a second priority making current web3 games being dis-engaging and tedious to play with. \n",
    "\n",
    "Although static games like *Axies Infinity* still hold the majority of the GameFi market we are starting to see the rise of higher quality metaverse games such as *Decentraland* and *The Sandbox*.\n",
    "\n",
    "A typical **triple A** game takes years to be built. For example the famous *Grand Theft Auto* by Rockstar took 3 years to develop and with smart contracts being relatively new, it is expected that a true triple A game is still at least a couple of years away. \n",
    "\n",
    "*Mimic Labs* tried to predict the future devolopment by looking into the speed of recent VR development and came to the conclusion that first triple A games probably won't be released before 2028:  \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='https://www.dropbox.com/s/u7sjgzi70p4y7iq/GameFi_future.png?raw=1' width=500px>   \n",
    "\n",
    "In the meantime it can be expected that more and more triple A game studios enter the blockchain world, bringing experienced game developer into the GameFi ecosystem and potentially transferring sucessfull traditionall games into the system. The *metaverse hype* might foster this trend. \n",
    "One example of such a studio is *WorldSpark*. With a team formed from multiple triple A game studios, the company raised $3 million in seed funding and is developing an on-chain action MOBA (Multiplayer online battle arena) game entitled *[Edenbrawl](https://www.edenbrawl.com)*. \n",
    "\n",
    "In general we might see more advanced on-chain games in which not only *play-to-earn* but more and more *play-for-fun* content dominates.  \n",
    "On the other side crypto gaming as a source of income might raise more and more attention in developing countries where players sometimes could earn more by playing than through their regular job. For example: the majority of Axie Infinity’s daily active users (DAUs) are in the Philippines where players play in behalf of an principals account. <a name=\"cite_ref-PAN\"></a>[<sup>[PAN]</sup>](#cite_note-PAN) "
