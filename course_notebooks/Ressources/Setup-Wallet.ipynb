Testnets are ... which allow you to discover, play around and test your application. You can also deposit money (i.e. tokens) on your testnet. But if you want to buy a real NFT you need to use your mainnet with real `ETH` *Let's add some money to your wallet ...*\n",

Every account has an account number (also called `account address`) and a `private key`. You will use both quite often. Whenever you \"change\" something on the blockchain (transfer money, mint NFT, etc.) you need your account address and your private key - think of them as your *name* and your *signature*.  \n",

        "(we recommend not to deposit real `eth`, i.e. on the mainnet - at least not for now until you become more confident within the blockchain world.). But of course if you want to interact with the \"real\" blockchain (in a way that you *change* the blockchain, e.g.: buying \"real\" NFTs, minting \"real\" tokens, exchanging \"real\" crypos, etc.) you need to have real `eth`. The quickest way to buy eth is within MetaMask: you can buy via `Paypal`, `Apple Pay`, `Credit Card`, `Bank Transfer`, etc.\n",
        "Keep in mind that you also need eth for transactions which usually does not cost money (e.g. ...). I.e. because for most transactions you need to pay a transaction fee, so called `gas fee`. It is the compensation for the `miner` who \"helps\" you with your transaction. \n",
