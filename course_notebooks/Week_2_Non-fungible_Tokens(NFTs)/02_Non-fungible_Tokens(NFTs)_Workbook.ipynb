Solidity does not have a built-in command to create random numbers like most other languages have. This makes total sense if you remind yourself that blockchain is a deterministic system. However, there are systems that provide blockchain with information coming from the real world: weather information, stock prices, sport events, and also randomness. These system are called **Oracles** and they can be imported into Solidity. We will learn more about Oracles in future lessons."

    "If you more interested in the trading 💰 or art 🖼  part of NFT, have a look at the excellent good-readable docs provided by 🌊 Opensea.

    "Instead of using **replit**, setup your own coding environment on your computer. We suggest **Visual Studio Code**. It's free, runs on all platforms and became one of the most used IDEs in the last years. You can download it [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/download). \n",

    "We recommend the first chapters (for setting up) and the NFT chapter of **Patrick Collins Solidity, Blockchain, and Smart Contract Course - Beginner to Expert** on Youtube 📺:.  *This is one of the best courses to learn blockchain coding and most of us learnt it thru this course.*\n",
