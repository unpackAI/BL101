Solidity does not have a built-in command to create random numbers like most other languages have. This makes total sense if you remind yourself that blockchain is a deterministic system. However, there are systems that provide blockchain with information coming from the real world: weather information, stock prices, sport events, and also randomness. These system are called **Oracles** and they can be imported into Solidity. We will learn more about Oracles in future lessons."
