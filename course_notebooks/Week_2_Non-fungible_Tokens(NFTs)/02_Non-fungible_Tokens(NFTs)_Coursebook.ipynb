    "## What are NFTs?\n",
    "NFT stands for *Non-fungible Tokens*. \n",
    "\n",
    "NFTs are smart contracts deployed on a blockchain that represent something *unique*. As we learned in **week 1** smart contracts are pre-specified agreements on the blockchain that evaluate data and execute automatically when certain conditions are met. Unlike our `helloworld` contract which is fungible (i.e. replaceable, interchangable), NFTs are unique.  Technically NFTs follow a different standard, the so called `ERC721` standard. Fungible tokens in contrast follow the `ERC20` standard.\n",
    "\n",
    "*For example: the dollar bill in your wallet is **fungible**: it has a serial number and a print date but every bill is interchangeable. You can use it for buying goods, give it as pocket money to your kid or put it into a safe (for future use). But whatever you do, you are only interested in the value - not in this particular bill. In other words: nobody keeps record about who used this bill and for what. \n",
    "The picture you took on your smart phone is **non-fungible**: although you can send it to other people, post it on social media, sell it, etc. you will always remain the creator of that image and the blockchain stores your address (and any future owner).*\n",
    "\n",
    "### What are NFTs made of?\n",
    "1. Each NFT has a **unique id** that distinguishes it form other NFTs. This is in contrast to a fungible token like `ETH`. All ETH are the same and you only care about *how many* ETHs you have.   \n",
    "2. NFTs can link to data stored outside of a smart-contract (called **off-chain**)."
   ]
  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "### The problem with on-chain stored data\n",
    "Data that is stored **on-chain** needs to be processed, verified, and replicated across the entire blockchain network. It can be very expensive to store large amounts of data. This is a problem for many NFT use cases, especially tokens that represent digital collectibles or artwork, where storing the entire work could cost the equivalent of millions of US Dollars.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The problem with off-chain stored data\n",
    "When an NFT is created and linked to a digital file that lives on some other system, how the data is linked is very important. There are a few reasons why traditional HTTP links aren't a great fit.   \n",
    "\n",
    "With an HTTP address like `https://cloud-bucket.provider.com/my-nft.jpg`, anyone can fetch the contents of `my-nft.jpg`, as long as the owner of the server pays their bills. However, there's no way to guarantee that the contents of `my-nft.jpg` are the same as they were when the NFT was created. The server owner can easily replace `my-nft.jpg` with something completely different at any time, causing the NFT to change its meaning.    \n",
    "\n",
    "This problem was demonstrated by an artist who [pulled the rug](https://cointelegraph.com/news/opensea-collector-pulls-the-rug-on-nfts-to-highlight-arbitrary-value) on NFTs he created by changing their images after they were minted and sold to others.\n",
    "\n",
    "### IPFS as solution\n",
    "IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) is a protocol and peer-to-peer network for storing and sharing data in a distributed file system.  \n",
    "IPFS solves the problem of *off-chain stored data* thanks to **Content Addressing**. Adding data to IPFS produces a **content identifier (CID)** which is directly derived from the data itself and links to the data in the IPFS network. Because a CID can only ever refer to one piece of content, we know that nobody can replace or alter the content without breaking the link.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the CID, anyone can fetch a copy of the data from the IPFS network as long as at least one copy exists on the network, even if the original provider has disappeared. This makes CIDs perfect for NFT storage. All we need to do is put the CID into an `ipfs://` URI like `ipfs://bafybeidlkqhddsjrdue7y3dy27pu5d7ydyemcls4z24szlyik3we7vqvam/nft-image.png`, and we have an immutable link from the blockchain to the data for our token."

    "### What do you actually get when you buy an NFT?   \n",
    "You own a unique token on a blockchain that references some off-chain data. The token is **non-fungible** (unique) and **immutable** (being on a blockchain). That’s all that an NFT guarantees: you own a unique and unchangeable reference to some data.\n",
    "Focusing on this core NFT definition, two main challenges arise.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. An NFT is only as good as the link to its data. The reference is just a line of code. But for an NFT to have value, others have to agree, it refers to valuable data.   \n",
    "\n",
    "2. The off-chain data itself has to exist, it has to be stored somewhere and it has to be accessible. There are many instances where NFT links return 404 errors later on – making those NFTs worthless.  "

    "## What are NFTs used for?\n",
    "Because NFTs are non-fungible they provide proof of ownership or coypright to the owner: everybody can see who created that NFT, where did it come from, who owned it and who is the current owner. Most NFTs are used for arts, video games, music, films, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Beside this, NFTs are still smart contracts, i.e. they can have additional functionality. \n",
    "Think for example about a piece of art that pays the artist a small fraction of the selling price whenever it changes ownership. You can insert a function in your NFT contract which exactly does this.\n",
    "\n",
    "Legally, the ownership of an NFT does not inherently grant copyright or intellectual property rights to the digital asset the NFT is linked to, but it provides evidence of ownership of that token."

    "### Other use cases of NFT\n",
    "Even if the NFT art market might *crash* in the future and we come to the conclusion that it all was a big *Ponzi scheme*, the hype about NFTs made them popular and famous. \n",
    "\n",
    "But NFTs can have many other possible use cases: <a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a>[<sup>[1]</sup>](#cite_note-2)\n",
    "- **\"Soulbound NFTs\"**. Driver’s licenses, diplomas, certifications, proof of attendance, etc. Soulbound can not be sold.  \n",
    "- **Retail**. Brands use NFTs to incentivize IRL transactions, leveraging creators to drive traffic to storefronts. For example, Yeezy NFTs that airdrop with purchases from Gap stores, or NFTs that unlock exclusive features for Tesla vehicles.  \n",
    "- **Rewards**. Brands will drop unique quests within communities, rewarding completion with NFTs. This could be anything from completing a questionnaire to referring members into the community and attending events.\n",
    "- **Legal**. Real estate, proof of ownership, royalties are all good use-cases for NFTs here.  \n",
    "- **Content Submission**. Users will submit content like short-form videos, reviews, and tutorials in exchange for NFTs. It’s a marketing flywheel. Rights can be programmed into contracts so that the use of the contributor’s content in advertising could yield their future profits.  \n",
    "- **Gaming**. Avatars as well as unique in-game inventory items could be NFTs. NFTs could create hive activity by incentivizing group behavior. MMORPGs that unlock levels once 10k users have aped in. Airdrops of rare NFTs to collector cohorts that have signed contracts to merge their base-layer NFTs.\n",
    "- **Collateralization**. To date, lenders have been averse to NFT holders borrowing against their assets. But as institutional $$$ flows in, and assets become better stores of value, collateral markets will promise flexibility and liquidity for all NFT holders, not just whales.  \n",
    "- **Fractionalization.** Splitting up NFTs into individual shares gives more people exposure to blue-chip assets, like owning a piece of a crypto punk. The result? More liquidity for holders and more appreciation of blue-chip assets as money enters the markets.  \n",
    "- **R&D.** Brands and creators will exchange NFTs for insights on product development: pain points, marketing claims, roadmap, and more. The NFTs will unlock early access to product releases and potential profit sharing. Brands will track and maintain these key relationships.  \n",
    "- **Education and Customer Support**. Upon demonstrating exceptional knowledge of a brand’s product, users can receive NFTs in exchange for onboarding newbies into the community, or providing support. This can be exponentially more impactful than a brand employee doing the same."

    "- `Web2` added social media, involving the user into the creating-of-content process - internet then meant *prosuming* (consuming and producing at the same time). However, most user of social platformd did not benefit from their content (beside the fun of sharing and interacting most users did not got compensated for posting on Instagram or tweeting on Twitter) and platforms like Facebook and Google became the most-valuable companies in the world during that time. **The internet became interactive.**   \n",
    "- `Web3` which technically started with the first introduction of blockchain in 2008 but in fact is about to shift the nature of the internet and is for many experts the future of the internet. Besides decentralicing content and therefore putting content into the hand of the *crowd* rather than in the hand of big companies and/or governments (at this point is funny if you think about what the original purpose of the internet was: a decentraliced network owned by all of us - the people), it also gives the user the possility to own and monetize his/her content. Although smart contracts based on ERC20 standard (which we learn about in the next week) also belong to `Web3`, the idea of non-fungibality and NFTs is so central to this new internet world that we mention it here during our NFT-week. **The internet becomes \"ownable\".**\n",

    "Although you could technically store your *digital art* directly on the blockchain (i.e. `onchain`) it would cost too much `gas` (👉🏻 *`gas` is the transaction fee for uploading/changing contracts on the blockchain*). Based on this [yellow paper](http://gavwood.com/paper.pdf), the gas fee to store one kilobyte of data is 640k gas. At the time of this writing (June 2022) one gas costs around 0.00000003 ETH (Source: https://ethgasstation.info/). This would mean that storing one kilobyte of data directly on the blockchain costs 0.0192ETH (22,7 US Dollars).\n",
