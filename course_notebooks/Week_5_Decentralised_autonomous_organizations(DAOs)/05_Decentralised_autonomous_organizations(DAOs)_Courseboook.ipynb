    "DAO stands for **D**ecentralised **A**utonomous **O**rganization. In its simplest form you can imagine it as a group of people with a joint bank acccount (= treasury). Since its decentralised, there is no single stakeholders who controls it's assets, and a community voting process is required to make decisions. Individuals can become part of a DAO by investing currency and exchanging it for the native token that governs the DAO. Their money is added to the treasury of the DAO, and the received tokens for their payment represent their stake and ownership which are necessary to participate in any votes that is posed by the community to the community. Additionally, the value of the DAOs native token can appreciate benefitting all stakeholders. \n",

    "#### DAOs vs Traditional Organizations\n",
    ">DAOs provide higher levels of transparency while reducing bureaucracy. They can minimize existing principal-agent dilemmas of organizations and therefore moral hazards. Tokens provide incentives to automatically align interests in the absence of third parties.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://www.dropbox.com/s/rrd15hnvls3jvw5/traditional_organization-vs-DAO.png?raw=1)  \n",
    "\n",
    "In traditional organizations all members have legal contracts which constitutes the relationship among the members and toward the organization: employment contracts, constitutional law in democracies, membership contract in clubs, etc. The motivation for the members to engage in the organisation (incentives) are salary, the voting outcome, the benefits of joining the club, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "DAOs, on the other hand, involve a set of people interacting with each other according to a self-enforcing open-source protocol. Instead of legal contracts, DAOs use a majority consensus defined in smart contracts and executed with tokens. Blockchains and smart contracts reduce transaction costs of management. Individual behaviour is incentivized with a token to collectively contribute to a common goal. Members of a DAO are not bound together by a legal entity, although the legal situation differs between countries and purpose of the DAO (👉🏻 Legality).\n",
    "\n",
    "**DAOs can solve the principal-agent dilemma**\n",
    "DAOs tackle an age-old problem of governance where the agents (e.g. manager, politicians) have the power to make decisions in behalf of the principals (e.g. shareholder, citicens). In those situations *moral hazard* can occur - a situation where the agent has an incentive to increase its exposure to risk because it does not bear the full costs of that risk. (e.g.: A manager decides a risky investment. If it is succesfull he will get a bonus payment, if it fails the shareholder will cover the losses.)  \n",
    "\n",
    "DAOs on the other hand are open-source, thus transparent and, in theory, incorruptible. All transactions of the organization are recorded and maintained on a blockchain. Interests of the members of the organization are – if designed correctly – aligned by the incentive rules tied to the native token. Proposals take the primary way for making decisions within a DAO, which are voted for by majority consensus of involved network actors. As such, DAOs can be seen as distributed organisms, or distributed Internet tribes, that live on the Internet and exist autonomously, but also heavily rely on specialist individuals or smaller organisations to perform certain tasks that cannot be replaced with automation. \n",
    "\n",
    "As opposed to traditional companies that are structured in a top-down manner, with many layers of management and bureaucratic coordination, DAOs provide an operating system for people and institutions that do not know nor trust each other, who might live in different geographical areas, speak different languages, and therefore be subject to different jurisdictions.\n",
    "\n",
    ">*While a traditional organization requires a lot of trust in the people behind it — especially on behalf of investors — with DAOs, only the code needs to be trusted.*\n",
    "\n",
    "While this might be easy to comprehend at first, the implications of what a DAO could mean to the blockchain community are huge. To put this into perspective, let's dive into an example of \"The DAO\", which at one point controlled approximately 14% of all ether (ETH) in circulation."

The DAO intended to operate like a venture capital fund to invest into projects in web3. During a creation period anyone was allowed to send ether to a governing ethereum wallet controlled by the DAO collective. Innovators could pitch ideas to the DAO community, upon which the community would initiate a vote whether to invest or not. If invested and the projects turns into a success, the entire community benefits.\n",

    "On June 17th, 2016, a hacker was able to steal 3.6 million ETH within a few hours, exploiting a loophole in the smart contracts that governed the DAO. This hack affected the entire ethereum ecosystem and its price. The founder of ethereum, Vitalik Buterin reacted swiftly and initiated a hard-forck, an update to the ethereum blockchain that effectively rolled back the Ethereum network’s history to before The DAO attack and reallocated The DAO’s ether to a different smart contract so that investors could withdraw their funds. This was extremely controversial, and since the ethereum founders did not unilateral power,miners, exchanges and node operators had to agree too.\n",

Once the contract is live on Ethereum, no one can change the rules except by a vote. If anyone tries to do something that's not covered by the rules and logic in the code, it will fail. And because the treasury is defined by the smart contract too that means no one can spend the money without the group's approval either. This means that DAOs don't need a central authority.

    "|--|---|--|  \n",
    "|**PROS:** |cheaper gas|more advanced tools|\n",
    "|**CONS:** |less advanced tools|gas expensive|  \n",
    "\n",
    "As with NFTs where we could store our image on-chain or off-chain, the same basic question arises when setting up a DAO. On-chain voting means that every vote happens on the blockchain. This is the most *decentralized* way. \n",
    "The advantage of off-chain voting is obvious: instead of many transactions the whole voting procedure can be done within one transaction resulting in dramatically less gas costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "When it comes to implementation of the voting mechanism we can put them into two categories:\n",
    "1. On-chain voting  \n",
    "2. Off-chain voting  \n",
    "\n",
    "### On-chain voting\n",
    "On-chain voting is what we saw in the Compound example: \n",
    "DAOs are smart contracts on the blockchain -> the voters call the vote function of the smart contract which is for voting -> the voters get verified by their wallet (e.g. Metamask) -> they send the transaction -> voting happened. \n",
    "But every transaction costs gas (in our example above 26.40 USD! for initiating the proposol). And the bigger the community the more gas has to be payed for every voting, i.e. everytime the community wants to change something to their DAO they have to pay for every vote. \n",
    "\n",
    " The benefits of an on-chain governance system is that it is predictable and stable. On the other side a governance structure should be flexible enough to deal with new challenges: if the structure is fully engineered in advance the organization might not be able to react quickly enough to new changes in its environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "So in summary, on-chain voting is:  \n",
    "- pro: the architecture is very easy, everything is on-chain, everything is transparent\n",
    "- contra: not so flexible, gas *(but there are a lot of approaches to solve the gas problem: Governance-as-a-Service provider like [GovernorDAO](https://governordao.org/) or random sampling of votes in combination with quadratic voting to help reduce costs while increasing civil resistance (👉🏻 quadratic voting).*\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Off-chain voting\n",
    "In Off-chain voting the voters send their signed transaction to a decentralized database like IPFS. At the end of the voting period all votes are counted in IPFS and the result will be delivered (via Oracle Chainlin) to the blockchain. This reduces the whole voting process to one single transaction. \n",
    "Beside using decentralized databases a DAO can use services like **Snapshot**. Snapshot summerizes all the signed transaction in a single transaction to save gas. This can reduce the voting costs by up to 99%.  Snapshot is one of the most popular applications for off-chain voting. But snapshot has no chainlink integration so far - making it cheap but not as safe as on-chain voting. \n",
    "\n",
    "So in summary, off-chain voting is:  \n",
    "- pro: effiecient, gas saving\n",
    "- contra: it needs to be implemented very carefully *(if you are running your entire DAO through a centralized oracle, you are essentially reintroducing a centralized intermediary and ruining the decentralization of your application)*\n"

    "Even if you do not consider attackers there are other obvious flaws with Coin Voting:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Large groups of small-holders are less successful in carrying out decisions than small groups of rich players (referred to as \"whales\").** Small-holders suffer from the tragedy of the commons, which means they have no incentive to vote because each one of them has a insignificant impact on the outcome. Even if there are incentives for voting, there is little reason for people to do their study and give their vote serious consideration.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **At the expense of other members of the community, coin vote governance only promotes the interest of coin holders.** Protocol communities are diverse and have a wide range of beliefs, visions, and objectives. Coin voting, however, only gives power to one constituency (coin holders, and especially wealthy ones), and leads to over-valuing the goal of making the coin price go up even if that involves harmful rent extraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Issues with conflicts of interest**: Giving voting power to a single constituency (coin holders), especially by wealthy one, runs the risk of exposing that elite to too many conflicts of interest (eg. investment funds or holders that also hold tokens of other DeFi platforms that interact with the platform in question).\n",
    "\n",
    "A [recent report](https://blog.chainalysis.com/reports/web3-daos-2022/) about the concentration of decision-making power in ten major DAOs found that on average, less than 1% of all holders have 90% of the voting power."

    "The obvious problem is how you are able to link the identity of an individual to his or her wallet. If one individual is able to create an infinite amount of wallets, Non-Coin Voting Governance is deemed to fail is it not? Indeed there are a few projects working on exactly this.\n",

    ">[ProofOfHumanity](https://app.proofofhumanity.id/) (or PoH) is a social identity verification system for humans on the Ethereum mainnet. User need to register with their wallet address and go through a few steps involving uploading a picture, video statement and going through a vouching process. After successful verification the user receives a token (*UBI token*) which identifies them as the person they are. The verficiation needs to be renewed after one year. \n",

Soulbound NFTs are permanent, non-transferable NFTs, meaning that they can't be given away or taken from your private blockchain wallet. While they could represent participation in real-life events or achievements, they may also indicate your membership within a community. A collection of Soulbound NFTs make up your Soul or on-chain identity. This not only provides a fine solution for Non-Coin Voting Governance, but also makes community wallet recovery possible (various stakeholders within the community you were part of confirm your identity to reaccess your wallet). Vitalik Buterin calls the greater future unlocked by Soulbound NFTs a \"Decentralized Society” (DeSoc).

    "### Hybrid Solutions\n",
    "\n",
    "There are some voting mechanisms that incorporate both governance models. One of such is called **Quadratic voting**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Quadratic voting is a collective decision-making procedure where individuals allocate votes to express the degree of their preferences, rather than just the direction of their preferences. This all means the results of a vote reflect the intensity of people’s preferences in collective decisions. Both Gitcoin or TheDAO utilize Quadratic Voting.\n",
    "\n",
    "*How it works?*\n",
    "Voters receive budgets of “Influence Power,” which they allocate to different options on the ballot to signal the intensity of their conviction. Every “Recorded Vote” uses the number of votes, squared of influence power.\n",
    "\n",
    "So if you put 1 Vote on an option, that uses 1 Influence Power,\n",
    "2 Votes on an option, uses 4 Influence Power,\n",
    "3 Votes on an option, uses 9 Influence Power, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the participation of a fake identity in the voting process could lead to unfair results, proof of identity is a key necessity with quadratic voting. \n",
    "\n",
    "To compare this with pure Coin and Non-Coin voting, voting power is more evenly distributed.\n",

    "As a consequence the question arises *how is the legal situation of DAOs?* Unfortunately, we could not find a clear answere The whole legal situation of DAO is still mostly undefined. But we can pose some questions to raise your awareness and give some first answers we found during our research: \n",
    "\n",
    "**Where is the registered office of a DAO?**  \n",
    "By definition, a DAO is a blockchain-based organization operating with no central location, headquarters, or centralized decision-making authority. \n",
    "DAOs are decentralized and exists solely on a blockchain with potentially thousands of members spread across the globe. \n",
    "If someone wants to sue a DAO, where to send the accusal documents? \n",
    "\n",
    "**How does a DAO enter a legally binding contract?**  \n",
    "And are members of a DAO personal liable for any action of the DAO (beside the value of the token they invested)?  \n",
    "The problem is that some lawyers might consider a DAO as a general partnership or unincorporated association with full personal liability of its members. In some countries, like Austria for example, there are trends in the legal literature to see DAOs as a civil law partnership. Civil law partnerships are usually defined as legal entities of at least two persons with the scope of conducting a common goal. Its partners are considered entrepreneurs in the scope of their business activity and all partners are personal liable.\n",
    "\n",
    "This unclear legal situation can make it also difficult for DAOs to find business partners as businesses and investors might be discouraged to engage with the DAO. \n",
    "\n",
    "A typical workaround is to adapt an *LLC Wrapper* for the DAO. An LLC in the USA is a limited liability company which protects its members from any personal liability and losses exceeding the companyies share capital. But personal liabiltiy can still exist in case of gross negligence - for all members or only for the managing directors, depending on the state. \n",
    "And most countries in the world have simular legal concepts. However, not all DAOs chose this business structure. Some worry that forming an LLC takes away the decentralization that is a key element of a DAO. \n",

    "**Are there any financial regulations regard the tokens a DAOs issues?**   \n",
    "In 2017, the large number of ICOs attracted the attention of the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The commission’s position was that the tokens offered in these ICOs had to be treated as securities under US law. As a consequence more and more blockchain projects followed a **dual-token model**.  The dual token model occurs when a blockchain project issues two tokens – one for fundraising and the other for utility. \n",

    "With the purpose of making the process of a DAO becoming an LLC easier and cheaper and attracting more DAOs, the US state Wyoming enacted a statute in 2021 allowing a new legal entity — a *DAO LLC* — to be formed.  Everybody can register a DAO in Wyoming. However, a Wyoming registered agent who can receive legal mail on behalf of the DAO is needed. The inital filing fee is 100 USD and the annual filing fee is 60 USD. The name of the DAO must include \"DAO LLC\".\n",

    "The legal situation of DAOs is currently a hot topic and it can be expected that other US states and countries will follow Wyomings example: The US state Tennesse established a similar law recently and the US state Vermont furthermore enacted a law that allows the creation and registration of a **BBLLC**: blockchain-based limited liability company. Countries like Australia and the Marshall Islands are also considering to adapt their corporate law to DAOs.\n",

    "The biggest promise of DAO is its decentralization and therefore liberalization of voting and participation. In reality, there is no such thing as a *fully* decentralized and autonomous organization. Depending on the governance rules, there are different levels of decentralization. While the network might be geographically decentralized, and have many independent but equal network actors, the governance rules written in the smart contract or blockchain protocol will always be a point of centralization and loss of direct autonomy. DAOs can be architecturally decentralized (independent actors run different nodes), and are geographically decentralized (subject to different jurisdictions), but they are logically centralized (the protocol). The question of how to upgrade the code – when and if necessary – is very often delegated to a set of experts who understand the techno-legal intricacies of the code, and therefore represent a point of centralization."
