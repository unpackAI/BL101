It obviates the need for trusted intermediaries, prioritizing decentralization, censorship resistance, and security.\n","\n","Each Uniswap smart contract, or pair, manages a liquidity pool made up of reserves of two ERC-20 tokens.\n","\n","Anyone can become a liquidity provider (LP) for a pool by depositing an equivalent value of each underlying token in return for pool tokens. These tokens track pro-rata LP shares of the total reserves, and can be redeemed for the underlying assets at any time.\n","\n","<center><img src=\"https://docs.uniswap.org/assets/images/lp-c0b1b03ef921f1325971fa8ab6e9a4f1.jpg\" alt=\"Paramater Settings in Liquidity Pool\" width=\"700\"/></center>\n","\n","Pairs act as automated market makers, standing ready to accept one token for the other. Because the relative price of the two pair assets can only be changed through trading, divergences between the Uniswap price and external prices create arbitrage opportunities. This mechanism ensures that Uniswap prices always trend toward the market-clearing price. Uniswap applies a 0.30% fee to trades.\n","\n","#### Why do we need Uniswap?\n","In a nutshell: 🥜 your ERC-20 token you just created is just a ERC-20 smart contract with some basic information (token name, symbol, decimals, number of tokens). For your token to become *valuable* and *tradeable* or *useable* (in any meaningful way) you need to back it up with \"cash\", a.k.a. other tokens which are *already* traded and therefore have *already* value.
