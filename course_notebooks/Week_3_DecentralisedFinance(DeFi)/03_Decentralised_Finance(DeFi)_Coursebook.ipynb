    "Let's start with the basics. DeFi stands for Decentralised Finance. Its a new and alternate financial system that is:\n",
    "1. **Open to everyone**: There are no prerequisites to participate in the DeFi ecosystem. Traditionally, if you want to register a bank account, you are required to provide identification, and in some cases also a tax number. DeFi allows any individual, to open up their own wallet with a phone and an internet connection, and both are becoming increasingly accessible, as opposed to access to a nearby bank.\n",
    "2. **Does not require trust**: In DeFi, the requirement for any financial institution as an intermediary, is removed. You, the individual can own your own assets, and are able to transact or trade instantaneously without approval.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is made possible via Blockchain technology, Cryptography and Smart Contracts. At current (06.03.2022), there is 73.07b USD invested in DeFI. This number represents the Total Value Locked (TVL), the total value of cryptocurrency locked in a smart contracts. TVL in DeFi protocols is down from 249b USD back in November 9th, 2021. You can see daily stats on DeFi TVL, and a list of the most dominant DeFi protocols [here](https://defillama.com/).\n",

    "### DeFi vs Traditional Finance\n",
    "To understand the innovation of DeFi is to understand of it differentiates from traditional finance from the perspective of a user.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Interaction Layer:\n",
    "    - Traditional Finance: Banks and certified accounts are the gateway into the traditional financial system. The way you withdraw funds, initiate transactions or invest is via branches, ATMs, online banking and more. Transactions are not public.\n",
    "    - DeFi: As a DeFi user you need to register a wallet, and can directly interact with DeFi protocols. Clearly, you require real funds to purchase Bitcoin or Ether, that can be purchased via various exchanges using your fiat currency (USD, EUR, etc.). All transactions are public for you to explore via Block Explorers (i.e. Etherscan) or other analytic tools (i.e. Footprint, Nansen etc.). In some countries you can even withdraw fiat currency using a Bitcoin ATM.\n",
    "2. Application Layer:\n",
    "    - Traditional Finance: Centralised Finances offers many financial products and services to invest your wealth. Importantly, all are regulated by the government and hold accountable in case of fraud. This protects the retail investor.\n",
    "    - DeFi: Mirroring the traditional financial system, DeFi offers similar and new innovative financial products (i.e. flash loans). These will be discussed in the following. Additionally, it needs to be highlighted that in DeFi regulation is essentially non-existent. While, this makes things easier, quicker and a lot more accessible, it also creates an easy way for fraudulent players, to scam retail investors of a lot of money (DO NOT CLICK ON RANDOM LINKS FROM UNVERIFIED EMAILS OR LINKS).\n",
    "3. Execution Layer:\n",
    "    - Traditional Finance: The executional layer, that executes the various trades or transactions initiated by you, are highly intransparent. This results in high transaction fees, limitations (i.e. limit on foreign transfers), and high waiting times.\n",
    "    - DeFi: Any transactions are not executed by an instituion, but by code. It does what you tell it to. And it does that fast with the least amount of friction.\n",

    "- reputation points in an online platform  \n",
    "- skills of a character in a game  \n",
    "- lottery tickets  \n",
    "- financial assets like a share in a company  \n",
    "- a fiat currency like USD  \n",
    "- an ounce of gold  \n",
    "- and more...   \n",
    "\n",
    "Last week we learnt about token standards. As a quick review: standards are like templates of solidity contracts with predefined methods. A widely used standard for building unique tokens is **ERC-721**. We used it when we built our NFT. \n",
    "\n",
    "The 4 most important token standards are:\n",
    "\n",
    "|  Name | Created | Use Cases |  \n",
    "| -- |-- |-- |   \n",
    "| ERC-20 | 2015 | Fungible token standard that provides basic functionality to transfer tokens, as well as allow tokens to be approved. |    \n",
    "| ERC-721 | 2018 | Non-Fungible Token standard |   \n",
    "| ERC-777 | 2017 | Standard that defines all the functions required to send tokens on behalf of another address, contract or regular account. |   \n",
    "| ERC-1155 | 2018 | A standard for contracts that manage multiple token types. |   \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Another thing you need to know about tokens is that they are not held by accounts. Tokens exist in contracts, which function like decentralized databases that map tokens to the appropriate Ethereum address. Also, it is the token contract that governs and specifies the rules that apply to a given token. With this, developers set the name, symbol, divisibility and other important token identifiers. \n",
    "Hence, the transfer of ownership of tokens only occurs when the current owner sends a request to the contract directing it to allocate part of the balance to another Ethereum wallet address. To register this transfer on the blockchain, the owner must pay a gas fee in ETH."

Think about company stocks, securities, cryptocurrencies or even money. Financial tokens are fungible or interchangeable or even tradeable. In other words: every ERC-20 token usually consists of many tokens. The owner of an ERC-20 (e.g. bitcoin, ether) token is not interested in a specific token rather than how many of these tokens she gets. The **Mona Lisa** would be an ERC721, a **dollar bill** an ERC-20. \n",

You can find examples at [Open Zeppelin](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/3.x/api/token/erc20). An interesting extension is [ERC20Burnable](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/3.x/api/token/erc20#ERC20Burnable): this allows token holders to destroy both their own tokens and those they have an allowance for.\n",
    "\n",
    "**ETH vs ERC20**  \n",
    "ETH is the native token of the Ethereum blockchain and it acts as the fuel of the network as each operation on the Ethereum blockchain needs to pay a corresponding amount of **gas**. Gas prices are denoted in small fractions of ether called gwei (1 gwei = 0.000000001 ETH). While ERC20 is the standard to obey in order to create applications (smart contract), the ERC20 token is serving as a currency for accessing the application.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Other Token Standards\n",
    "The complexity of the DeFi ecosystems with many different use cases demands for more token standards to overcome the limitations of ERC-20. However, none of these standards are as popular as ERC-20 and the field is quickly developing.\n",
    "\n",
    "**ERC-1363**<a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>[1]</sup>](#cite_note-1)    \n",
    "One example for other token standards is the ERC-1363. This token standard allows to implement an ERC-20 token that can be used for payments. It's also named **Payable Token**. ERC-1363 allows to execute code after the token was transfered without the need of another transaction and paying gas fees twice. The originator of this token lists these use cases:\n",
    "- create a token payable crowdsale  \n",
    "- selling services for tokens  \n",
    "- paying invoices  \n",
    "- making subscriptions  \n",

    "#### Token vs. Coins  \n",
    "A crypto **coin** is a crypto asset (crypto asset refers to all kinds of cryptos) that has its own blockchain, as opposed to running on another crypto asset’s blockchain. You could also call a crypto coin a cryptocurrency or a *native token*. Coins are usually used only for payments. Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin are all coins.  \n",
    "\n",
    "A **token** on the other hand runs on another blockchain. The best known example is the ERC-20 token and there exists way more tokens than coins in the blockchain ecosystem *(remember: we  also called our NFT sometimes a token.)* Tokens have various use cases, including payment - but many more."

    "#### Ethereum and Ether (ETH)\n",
    "First proposed in 2013 by Russian-Canadian computer programmer **Vitalik Buterin**, Ethereum was designed to expand the utility of cryptocurrencies by allowing developers to create their own special applications. Unlike traditional apps, Ethereum-based applications are called *decentralized applications*, or *dapps* for short. Dapps are self-executing thanks to the use of smart contracts.  \n",
    "\n",
    "As we already know, **smart contracts** are code-based programs that are stored on the Ethereum blockchain and automatically carry out certain functions when predetermined conditions are met. That can be anything from sending a transaction when a certain event takes place or loaning funds once collateral is deposited into a designated wallet.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is the difference between Ethereum and Ether?**   \n",
    "**Ethereum** is a technology that uses blockchain. To cover the cost of this power, you need to pay a fee — and **Ether** is the token by which you make this payment.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can call it the cryptocurrency of the Ethereum network.\n",
    "\n",
    "As of March 18, 2022, there are 120 million coins in circulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the names Ether and Ethereum are often used interchangeably. \n",
    "\n",
    "Ethereum is together with bitcoin by far the moste important cryptocurrency - you can see that also from the price chart of Ethereum: it moves similar to that of Bitcoin:"

    "#### Altcoin\n",
    "Altcoins (\"alternative coins\") are generally defined as all cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin (although some people consider *all cryptos beside Bitcoin **and** Ethereum* as Altcoins because most cryptos are forked from one of the two).   \n",
    "There are tens of thousands of altcoins on the market. In fact the crypto we are going to build in the workbook can be considered as altcoin, too.  \n",
    "It is possible for an altcoin to fall into more than one category, such as **TerraUSD**, which is a stablecoin *and* utility token.\n",
    "\n",
    "A typicial use case for the creation of altcoins is to raise funds for specific projects. An initial coin offering (ICO) is the cryptocurrency industry’s equivalent of an initial public offering (IPO). A company looking to raise money to create a new coin, app, or service launches an ICO to raise funds.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the token **Bananacoin** forked from Ethereum in 2017 was a way to raise funds for organic banana plantations in Laos. The project claimed that purchaser of the token become owners of a \"...real banana plantation...\". However, the project ended after raising $4.8 million, with unpublished project results and 12% of the tokens redeemed.   "

    "\n",
    "It is a cryptocurrency forked from Litecon (and therefore it is a token and not a coin). Doge Coin was invented by two software engineers who decided to create a payment system as a *joke*, making fun of the wild speculation in cryptocurrencies at that time. In January 2021, Doge Coin went up over 800% in 24 hours as a result of attention from *Reddit* and Tweets from *Elon Musk*.   \n",
    "April and May 2021 is sometimes named as the *meme coin season*, with hundreds of these cryptocurrencies posting enormous percentage gains based on pure speculation. Doge Coin was one of them:  "

    "### Decentralised Exchanges\n",
    "\n",
    "Decentralized exchanges or Dexes, in opposite to standard, allow for exchanging crypto assets in a completely decentralized and permissionless way without giving up the custody of the coins. There are 2 main types of dexes. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Order-book based Decentralised Exchanges\n",
    "In the case of an order-book exchange, all trade requests will be listed as open orders for a specific trading pair. An example of an order book could be for the BTC/USD trading pair. The order book will have the corresponding buy and sell orders that customers have placed on the exchange to either buy or sell Bitcoin for US Dollars. However, it is important to note that placing an order does not guarantee someone else will agree to take the offer. If anyone on the exchange places a better offer than the one we place, then the better offer will be taken first.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Automated Market Maker (AMM)\n",
    "The order-book system has obvious flaws (i.e. no guarantee for trade, time delay, requires high activity of open orders). Such process can be described as a peer-to-peer model (P2P). AMM's go beyond a P2P model and allow anyone to make instantaneous exchanges between two pairs of assets by using a model called peer-to-pool-to-peer (P2Pool2P). Instead of requiring individuals to create open orders, each token pair (i.e. ETH/BTC) is actually underpinned by a liquidity pool. Liquidity pools are smart contracts that hold balances of two unique tokens and enforce rules around depositing and withdrawing them. You can literally imagine them as a pool of money that holds both tokens, and anyone can take out one currency as long the other is put back into the pool. These pools are created by liquidity providers who provide liquidity by depositing (staking) their assets. As a return, they earn fees from transactions on the DeFi platform they provide liquidity on. The transaction fees are distributed proportionally to all the liquidity providers in the pool, so the more crypto assets you stake the more fees you'll earn.\n",

    "### Lending & Borrowing\n",
    "\n",
    "In DeFi, the concept is simple. A smart contract stores the funds provided by lenders, and manages the payout to borrowers. Lenders receive an interest on their deposited amount, while borrowers have to pay an interest on the amount they borrowed. Any user can become a borrower and lender without having to hand over personal information, identity or undergo KYC (know your customer) procedures. At any time lenders can redeem the deposited assets and borrows can pay back part or all of their debt.\n",
    "\n",
    "How can we ensure that the money is being paid back?\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to **borrow**, a user traditionally has to provide a collateral that holds value. The collateral could be a cryptocurrency, or in some cases even an NFT. Generally, most loans are overcollaterals, which means that the borrower has to provide assets that are worth more than the actual loan. This depends on the collateral factor of the collateral. In some cases it can be 75%, which implies that for 100% value of the collateral, the borrower can receive 75% in form of a loan. Additionally, the amount that can be borrowed also depends on the amount that is locked inside the smart contract. Normally, in active markets, there should be enough liquidity, however, it can happen that the locked assets provided by lenders are not enough to satisfy the demand by the borrowers. Liquidity is provided by liquidity pools, however oppositely to a \"trading pool\" used in a decentralised exchange, we now work with \"lending pools\" that simply do not require two pairs of assets inside one pool.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why would anyone borrow if that means more value has to be employed as collateral? Think about it for a little.\n",
    "\n",
    "Selling your assets means closing your position on that particular asset. Hence, if you are long on the asset, you would not be entitled to the potential upside value gain. By borrowing you are able to obtain liquidity (working capital) without selling your assets.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **lender's** interest heavily depends on that balance. In fact, the interest rate is determined by the ratio that exists between the supplied and borrowed tokens in a particular market. The higher the demand to borrow for specific token, the higher its interest. This interest is calculated as the APY (annual percentage yield). It is important to mention, that the lender receives the native token as interest of the DeFi protocol that is being used.\n",

    "The People’s Bank of China (PBOC) banned financial institutions from handling Bitcoin transactions in 2013 and went further by banning ICOs and domestic cryptocurrency exchanges in 2017. However, the PBOC has been working on introducing an official digital currency (digital Yuan) since 2012. In late 2020, the Chinese government drafted a law that conferred legal status on PBOC’s digital Yuan: the legislation is expected to result in the demise of the fiat currency, and the introduction of currency controls covering exchanges and currency fungibility. \n",

The Salvadorean government also launched an app, \"Chivo Wallet\", which allowed users to digitally trade both Bitcoin and Dollars, and gave major incentives for downloading it. In April 2022 **Central African Republic (CAR)** followed El Salvador to approve Bitcoin as legal tender.\n",
