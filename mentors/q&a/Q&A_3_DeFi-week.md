> ### I am still confused about public and private key, and when to use which!
🥜 In a nutshell:  `public key` is like your bank account number, `private key` is your password and the `secret phase` is an extra password for moving your wallet to other computer/phone/browser.

Because you can extract the `public key` out of any `private key` *(but not the other way around)*.   

    👉🏻 In our workbook is a code example!
