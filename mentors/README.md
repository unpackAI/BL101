1. Two Zoom sessions per week 📆   
    - Weekday-Session: Moderating students presentation & presenting weekly course content   
    - Weekend-Session: Q&A-Session (answering question & discussing weekly course content)     
2. Actively engage in Wechat Group Chat 🗣  
3. Make yourself familiar with: 
    - course- and workbook content 📗📓  
    - week 2 assignment(s) on `replit` 👨‍💻  

### Sessions 🏫
>Online sessions via Zoom are twice per week.   

Starting with a kick-off session (weekend), the bootcamp continous with weekly (weekday) sessions where students present their weekly assignment and mentors introduce the course content (coursebook and workbook) for that week. The following weekend-session is for answering questions and discussing the course content.

### Some Tips 💁🏻‍♀️
- try to avoid long powerpoint presentations
- switch between your presentation and 
    - online coding demonstrations,
    - online tools you want to explain (e.g. Metamask 🦊, Faucets), 
    - interesting websites (e.g. etherscan, Games, OpenSea 🌊) 
    - etc.
- ask questions, let students engage and interact

### Additional Ressources 📦  
#### Q&As for weekend session
>The weekend-session is for answering student's question and discussing the course content.    

However, it might happen that students don't have questions and no discussion evolves. In this case you can use:   
- [Q&As](q&a) 👈🏻 questions and answers from students from previous cohorts     

and ask them into the group. 

#### Live Coding Demonstrations 💻
